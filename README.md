TripMate is a web application designed to connect solo travelers and groups with like-minded travel partners. Using this platform, users can post their upcoming trips, join trips created by others, find travel buddies, and share their journey experiences.

This project aims to build a community for people who love to travel, make new friends, and explore the world together.
